The person might not be able to remember what they&rsquo;ve done or said, or the answer they received to a question. For example, they may keep checking to be sure they have their wallet or handbag with them, or keep checking their fridge to make sure they have enough food.</p><p align="left">It is very likely the person does not know they keep asking the same question or repeating the same action. Often if someone is repeating the same question, they need an emotional rather than factual response. This may be because the person feels confused or anxious. They need comfort, security or to feel included or reassured rather than the repeated answer to their question. For example, if they keep asking what day it is they may need reassuring they haven&rsquo;t forgotten something rather than needing to know that it&rsquo;s Monday.</p><p align="left"><strong>Tips for managing repetitive behavior</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left">Try to be patient and keep your tone level and calm.</li><li><p align="left">If the person keeps asking about the time or date, consider putting a calendar or clock somewhere they can easily see it.</li><li><p align="left">Think about what need might be behind the behavior. For example, if the person keeps asking if they&rsquo;ve been to the supermarket, they may be worried about running out of food.</li><li><p align="left">Give the person the answer that they are looking for, even if you have to repeat it several times. If the person living with dementia is still able to read and comprehend, it may help to write it down and post it in a prominent location.</li><li><p align="left">If the person keeps looking for a particular item, have an allocated place for it that is easy to see and access.</li><li><p align="left">Look at what may be triggering the behavior &ndash; for example, does this happen the same time of day or around the same people? </li><li><p align="left">The person&rsquo;s life history is helpful to bear in mind. For example, if they used to work in a caf&eacute;, restaurant or pub, they may feel the need to keep wiping down surfaces.</li><li><p align="left">Focus on the emotion, not the behavior. Rather than reacting to what the person is doing, think about how they are feeling.</li><li><p align="left">Sometimes the person&rsquo;s repetitive actions seem anxious &ndash; for example they repetitively zip and unzip their cardigan, twist their fingers or keep taking their glasses off and putting them back on again. If so, there may be products that can help to provide reassurance such as fidget or twiddle muffs or sensory blankets. </li><li><p align="left">If the behavior is not harmful or causing a problem, accept that the person finds it comforting and reassuring and let it be.</li></ul>',

Then you can deal with the cause before the problem behaviors start.</li><li><p align="left">Doing nothing can make things worse. Try to find the causes of the behavior. If you deal with the causes, the behavior may stop.</li><li><p align="left">Slow down and try to relax if you think your own worries may be affecting the person living with dementia. Try to find a way to take a break from caregiving.</li><li><p align="left">Allow the person to keep as much control in his or her life as possible.</li><li><p align="left">Try to distract the person with a favorite snack, object, or activity.&nbsp;</li><li><p align="left">Reassure them. Speak calmly. Listen to the person&rsquo;s concerns and frustrations. Try to show that you understand if the person is angry or fearful.</li><li><p align="left">Keep well-loved objects and photographs around the house. This can make the person feel more secure.</li><li><p align="left">Reduce noise, clutter, or the number of people in the room.</li><li><p align="left">Try gentle touching, soothing music, reading, or walks.</li><li><p align="left">Build quiet times into the day, along with activities.</li><li><p align="left">Try to keep to a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating at the same time each day. Coping with changes is hard for&nbsp;someone living with dementia.</li></ul><p align="left"><strong>Here are things the doctor can do:</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left">Give the person a medical exam to find any problems that may cause the behavior. These problems might include pain, depression, or the effects of certain medicines.</li><li><p align="left">Check the person&rsquo;s vision and hearing each year.</li><li><p align="left">Anti-anxiety drugs are used to treat agitation. These drugs can cause sleepiness, dizziness, falls, and confusion. Therefore, doctors recommend using them only for short periods of time.&nbsp;</li><li><p align="left">Antipsychotics are drugs used to treat agitation and aggression. Side effects of using these drugs can be serious, including increased risk of death in some older people living with dementia. They should ONLY be given to people living with dementia when the doctor agrees that the symptoms are severe.</li></ul><p align="left"><strong>Here are some important things to do when the person is aggressive:</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left">Protect yourself and your family members from aggressive behavior. If you have to, stay at a safe distance from the person until the behavior stops.</li><li><p align="left">As much as possible, protect the person from hurting themself.&nbsp;</li><li><p align="left">Ask the doctor or dementia specialist if medicine may be needed to prevent or reduce agitation or aggression.</li></ul>',

Ultimately, the person living with dementia is biologically experiencing a profound loss of their ability to negotiate new information and stimulus. It is a direct result of the disease.</p><p align="left">Situations that may lead to agitation include:</p><ul><li><p align="left">Moving to a new residence or nursing home</li><li><p align="left">Travel, hospitalization, or the presence of houseguests</li><li><p align="left">Changes in caregiver arrangements</li><li><p align="left">Misperceived threats</li><li><p align="left">Fear and fatigue resulting from trying to make sense out of a confusing world</li></ul><p align="left"><strong>Tips to help prevent agitation</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left"><strong>Ask if you can help them. </strong>Asking if you can help them and reminding them that they&#39;re safe can be effective methods to reducing anxiety.

  stimulus: '<strong>Apathy and Dementia</strong><p align="left">Sometimes a person living with dementia may seem to lose interest in doing things they used to enjoy. When it goes on for a long time and interferes with daily living, this is a condition known as &lsquo;apathy&rsquo;.</p><p align="left">Apathy in dementia is a loss of motivation or drive. A person may need a lot of encouragement just to do seemingly small things. Without this support they may well do nothing. <br /><br /> Some people describe apathy as appearing to &lsquo;give up&rsquo; or withdrawing into a shell. It can be very hard to witness as it may feel like losing the person. It can also be difficult to support someone who doesn&rsquo;t appear to care what happens to them, who doesn&rsquo;t smile or laugh, or seem to have feelings about other people.<br /><br /> Most people living with dementia will develop apathy &ndash; particularly during the later stage of the condition. The timing and nature of apathy may differ depending on the type of dementia.</p><p align="left"><strong>What causes apathy in a person living with dementia?</strong></p><p align="left">There are several reasons why a person living with dementia might develop apathy. A very common reason is that it develops gradually as an emotional response to the difficulties of living with dementia.<br /><br /> Dementia can make many things much harder to do. Simple, everyday activities that used to be easy need a lot more effort and patience and often things go wrong. This can be very upsetting and can knock a person&rsquo;s confidence. They may feel ashamed, or even that they are embarrassing others.<br /><br /> For some people living with dementia, apathy may be caused by damage to certain parts of the brain involved in motivation. Almost everything we do is driven by decisions about effort and reward. If something is thought to be &lsquo;worth the effort&rsquo;, this provides motivation which then drives action. <br /><br /> However, when these thought processes stop working properly, the person may not be motivated to act or get started with a task. For some people, if they do manage to get started, they may struggle to keep going or become overwhelmed as they forget what they were doing and give up.</p><p align="left"><strong>Managing apathy </strong></p><p align="left">Try to find tasks and activities the person will enjoy and find meaningful, even if they only engage with them for a short time. A daily routine may help.</p><p align="left">Sometimes a person may seem apathetic when they are just finding it difficult to start an activity. Try to help the person by starting it first or breaking it down into chunks, as they may then be able to carry on with it.</p><p align="left">The person may stay in one position for a long time (such as sitting in a chair or lying in a bed) and not move around much. Doing this puts them at risk of stiff joints and pressure ulcers (bedsores).</p><p align="left">Try to help the person to change position regularly. This can help to improve blood circulation and relieve pressure on certain areas of their body. Check regularly for any rashes, discoloration of the skin or pressure ulcers. If pressure ulcers aren&rsquo;t treated early, they can become painful and infected. Pressure-relieving mattresses and cushions are available.</p><p align="left">If you feel frustrated, try to stay calm and don&rsquo;t blame the person. They are not being lazy, unhelpful or uncaring &ndash; the apathy is not their choice.</p>',

They may refuse to eat it or may spit it out. The person may become angry or agitated, or behave in a challenging way during mealtimes.</p><p align="left">If a person isn&rsquo;t eating enough, it can lead to weight loss and less muscle strength. They may also feel tired and weak. This can make them frailer and less able to recover from infections or viruses.</p><p align="left"><strong>What can cause poor appetite?</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left"><strong>Communication</strong> &ndash; the person living with dementia may have problems communicating that they&rsquo;re hungry, that they don&rsquo;t like the food they have been given or that it&rsquo;s too hot. Or they may be unsure what to do with the food. They may communicate their needs through their behavior. For example, they may refuse to eat or hold food in their mouth. You could try giving them a choice of food, or using prompts and pictures so they can choose the food they would like.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Pain</strong> &ndash; the person may be in pain or discomfort, which can make eating difficult. They may have problems with their dentures, sore gums, or painful teeth. Dental care, oral hygiene, and regular mouth checks are important.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Tiredness and concentration</strong> &ndash; tiredness can cause people living with dementia to not eat or give up partway through a meal. It can also lead to other difficulties such as problems with concentration or with co-ordination. People living with dementia may have difficulties focusing on a meal all the way through. It&rsquo;s important to be aware of this and support the person to eat when they are most alert.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Medication</strong> &ndash; changes to medication or dosage can result in appetite changes. If you think this may be the case, speak to a pharmacist or your doctor.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Physical activity</strong></a> &ndash; if the person is not very active during the day, they may not feel hungry. Encouraging them to be active will be good for their wellbeing and may increase their appetite.

They can take the form of paranoia, which makes the person feel threatened, even if there is no or little reason to feel this way. Dementia can make a person suspicious of the people around them.</p><p align="left"><strong>What are delusions?</strong></p><p align="left">A person experiencing a delusion may feel that they are being watched, or that someone is acting against them. They may jump to conclusions without much evidence.</p><p align="left">If the person you care for has delusions, this can be very difficult to cope with, especially if they are convinced that you have done something wrong or are trying to harm them. Try to remember that their delusions feel as real to them as your reality feels to you. You will not generally be able to convince a person experiencing delusions that they are wrong or mistaken.</p><p align="left">If this is a sudden change, make an urgent appointment with the doctor to rule out delirium, which is a medical emergency. If delusions are ongoing and causing distress, the doctor may consider a drug treatment.</p><p align="left"><strong>What causes delusions?</strong></p><p align="left">A person living with dementia may be unable to put bits of information and memories together correctly, which can lead them to draw false conclusions and believe something that isn&rsquo;t true.</p><p align="left"><strong>Common delusions include:</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left"><strong>Theft &ndash; </strong>for example, if a person living with dementia forgets where they placed an item, this can cause them to become paranoid and believe it has been stolen. This worry can also lead to them hiding things in unusual places, which in turn leads to more items going &lsquo;missing&rsquo;.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Fear of being followed or harmed </strong>&ndash; for example, if a person living with dementia notices someone walking behind them, they may believe that person is following them to try to harm them</li><li><p align="left"><strong>A belief that those closest to them are trying to harm them &ndash; </strong>this could range from believing that a friend is bringing them food because they want to poison them, to believing a partner is being unfaithful.</li><li><p align="left"><strong>Not believing their home to be their real home  &ndash; </strong>This is a delusion if they believe their home to be somewhere they have never lived. However, if they think of home as one they used to live in, often this is caused by &lsquo;time shifting&rsquo;.</li></ul><p align="left"><strong>When discussing a specific delusion with the person:</strong></p><ul><li><p align="left">Acknowledge their distress and how they must be feeling. Dismissing their concerns or trying to distract them without acknowledging their concerns first, can cause the situation to escalate and cause them to lose trust in their carer. For example, if the person thinks a carrier has been stealing, listen to them. Acknowledge how they must be feeling, take their concern seriously, and suggest supporting them to find the missing items.</li><li><p align="left">Gently suggest another activity first, which may distract the person and cause them to forget their delusion.</li><li><p align="left">Try to gently offer an alternative explanation for what may have happened, and present this as another possibility alongside their delusion, rather than an opposing view.</li></ul><p align="left"><strong>See the doctor</strong></p><p align="left">If a person living with dementia is having severe delusions and there is a fear of self-harm or caregiver harm, or if the delusion is extremely troubling to the person, it&#39;s important to have a medical evaluation to determine if medication is needed.</p> <p align="left">The first line of treatment is non-drug approaches, but if these strategies fail and symptoms are severe, medication may be appropriate. While antipsychotic medications can be effective in some situations, they are associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in older adults living with dementia and must be used carefully. Work with the doctor to learn both the risks and benefits of medication before making a decision.</p>',

For example, a person living with dementia may see children playing in the living room when no children exist.</p><p align="left"><strong>What causes hallucinations?</strong></p><p align="left">Visual hallucinations are usually caused by damage to the brain. They are more common in people living with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease can also have hallucinations.</p><p align="left">Hallucinations can also be caused by physical illness including fever, seizure, stroke, and migraine. They can be caused by infection such as a urinary tract infections (UTIs). If a person with a memory impairment or dementia has a UTI, this can cause sudden and severe confusion known as &lsquo;delirium&rsquo;. Diseases that cause inflammation and infection, such as pneumonia, can interfere with brain function and cause delirium. Some people with delirium will have hallucinations. Delirium is a medical emergency.</p><p align="left">Hallucinations are a rare side effect of many medications. The drugs for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease can often trigger hallucinations. Speak to your doctor before making any changes to medications.</p><p align="left">Some people with worsening vision start to see things that aren&rsquo;t there (visual hallucinations) because of their deteriorating sight and not from any other condition, such as dementia or a mental health problem. This is called Charles Bonnet syndrome.</p><p align="left">People living with dementia are often thought to be hallucinating when in fact they are simply mistaken about what they have seen. <strong>Misperceptions </strong>happen when the person sees one thing as something else. For example, mistaking blue floor tiles for water. <strong>Misidentifications</strong> happen when the person has problems identifying specific objects and people. For example, mistaking their son for their husband.</p><p align="left">If a person living with dementia has ongoing disturbing hallucinations, seek medical help. An illness or medication may cause these behaviors. Medicines are available to treat these behaviors but must be used with caution.</p><p align="left"><strong>How does a person experience hallucinations?</strong></p><p align="left">Some people living with dementia will have hallucinations in different senses &ndash; for example:</p><ul><li><p align="left">Auditory hallucinations &ndash; hearing things that aren&rsquo;t there, like voices or footsteps</li><li><p align="left">Olfactory hallucinations &ndash; smelling things that aren&rsquo;t there, such as smoke or perfume</li><li><p align="left">Tactile hallucinations &ndash; physically feeling things that aren&rsquo;t there, such as being kissed or insects crawling over their skin</li><li><p align="left">Gustatory hallucinations &ndash; tasting things that aren&rsquo;t there, such as a metallic taste in their mouth.</li></ul><p align="left">Hallucinations can be extremely distressing and can lead to the person living with dementia becoming frightened and in need of support. However, some people find the hallucinations pleasant or comforting. It often depends on what they are hallucinating and how others respond.</p><p align="left"><strong>Coping with Hallucinations</strong></p><p align="left">Here are some tips for coping with hallucinations:</p><ul><li><p align="left">Discuss with the doctor any illnesses the person living with dementia has and medicines they are taking. Sometimes an illness or medicine may cause hallucinations.</li><li><p align="left">Try not to argue with the person about what they see or hear.

A person with dementia experiences physical changes in their brain because of their condition. These changes can affect how much, and how well they sleep.</p><p align="left">Late afternoon and early evening can be difficult for some people living with dementia. They may experience sundowning&mdash;restlessness, agitation, irritability, or confusion that can begin or worsen as daylight begins to fade&mdash;often just when tired caregivers need a break.</p><p align="left">Sundowning can continue into the night, making it hard for people living with dementia to fall asleep and stay in bed. As a result, they and their caregivers may have trouble getting enough sleep and functioning well during the day.</p><p align="left"><strong>Possible causes</strong></p><p align="left">It is common for a person with dementia to have other long-term health conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or depression. Sometimes the drugs used to manage these conditions can also make a person&rsquo;s sleep worse.</p><p align="left">Dementia can affect the production of a sleep hormone in the brain called melatonin. This helps the person to feel sleepy when it gets darker in the evening. As a person&rsquo;s dementia progresses, their brain may make less melatonin, which makes it harder to fall asleep in the evening.</p><p align="left">The causes of sundowning are not well understood. One possibility is that dementia-related brain changes can affect a person&rsquo;s &ldquo;biological clock,&rdquo; leading to confused sleep-wake cycles. This may result in agitation and other sundowning behaviors.</p><p align="left">Other possible causes of sundowning include:</p><ul><li><p align="left">Being overly tired</li><li><p align="left">Unmet needs such as hunger or thirst</li><li><p align="left">Depression</li><li><p align="left">Pain</li><li><p align="left">Boredom</li><li><p align="left">Coping with sundowning</li></ul><p align="left">Look for signs of sundowning in the late afternoon and early evening.
